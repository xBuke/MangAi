                        <div id="post-content" class="post-content prose" data-post-content><p>AI agents – systems that autonomously answer inquiries, schedule appointments, or turn website visitors into qualified leads – are no longer reserved for large corporations. Small and medium businesses in Croatia and the region are increasingly using them because they reduce the load on reception, sales, and call centres without sacrificing communication quality. In this article we present concrete examples from different industries.</p><h2>What an AI agent can do for SMEs</h2><p>An AI agent can conduct conversations on web chat, WhatsApp, or email; schedule appointments in a calendar; answer common questions about pricing, opening hours, or services; and qualify leads (e.g. "buy or rent?") and hand them to the sales team with context. The key is that the agent works 24/7 and that humans supervise and adapt it as needed.</p><h3>Local examples by industry</h3><p><strong>Hair and beauty salons</strong> – the agent can book appointments, send reminders, explain prices and services, and collect basic client info before arrival. This is especially useful for smaller salons that don't have full-time reception staff.</p><p><strong>Real estate agencies</strong> – the agent can answer inquiries about flats and houses, filter buyers by location and budget, and schedule viewings. Sales agents receive prepared leads instead of cold calls.</p><p><strong>Dental practices</strong> – booking check-ups, reminders, answers to common questions (e.g. emergencies, pricing). Reduces the number of missed calls during business hours.</p><p><strong>Auto services and mechanics</strong> – accepting service orders, explaining services and prices, reminders for regular maintenance. Especially useful in peak season when demand is higher.</p><p><strong>Law firms</strong> – the agent can triage inquiries (e.g. property law, labour law), collect basic information, and book a consultation with a lawyer. It does not give legal advice but directs clients appropriately.</p><h2>Three main use cases</h2><h3>1. Customer support</h3><p>The agent resolves common inquiries without queue time. Complex cases are escalated to human support with full context. For more on introducing automation into processes, see our <a href="ai-automatizacija-poslovanja.html">article on AI business automation</a>.</p><h3>2. Bookings and scheduling</h3><p>Integration with a calendar lets clients book appointments themselves. The agent checks availability, sends confirmation and reminders. Particularly suitable for service businesses with many short slots.</p><h3>3. Lead qualification</h3><p>The agent asks targeted questions and labels leads as hot, warm, or cold. Sales focuses on those with the highest conversion probability. For a broader overview of tool selection, see our <a href="ai-alati-hrvatska.html">overview of AI tools for businesses in Croatia</a>.</p><h2>Checked steps for implementation</h2><p>Before deploying an AI agent, it helps to have a clear <a href="ai-strategija-mali-biznis.html">AI strategy for small business</a> – at least a chosen first use case and a way to measure success.</p><ul><li>Pick one main channel (e.g. web chat or WhatsApp).</li><li>List 10–15 most common questions and answers – the agent will use these as a base.</li><li>Define when the agent escalates to a human (e.g. complaint, complex inquiry).</li><li>Test with a smaller group of users before full launch.</li><li>Measure resolved inquiries without human intervention and user satisfaction.</li></ul><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>AI agents for support and sales have become accessible to smaller businesses in Croatia and the region. Starting with one clear scenario – bookings, common inquiries, or lead qualification – delivers quick value with minimal risk. MangAi helps SMEs choose and implement such solutions step by step.</p></div>
