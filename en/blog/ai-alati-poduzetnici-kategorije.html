The challenge is not lack of choice but choosing the right tool for the right task. In this article we organize tools by category and provide criteria for when to use which, and when AI is not the right choice.</p><h2>Categories of AI tools</h2><h3>Automation</h3><p>Tools for connecting apps (e.g. Zapier, Make), workflow automation, and RPA. Useful for repetitive tasks: sending emails, updating CRM, generating reports. For a detailed introduction to implementation, see our <a href="ai-automatizacija-poslovanja.html">article on AI business automation</a>.</p><h3>Marketing</h3><p>Content generation for social media, email campaigns, SEO copy, ads. They help produce content faster – but quality and brand voice remain human responsibilities.</p><h3>Sales</h3><p>CRM with AI recommendations, automated follow-up emails, lead qualification, web chatbots. They reduce manual work for the sales team and allow focus on closing deals.</p><h3>Customer support</h3><p>Chatbots, ticketing systems with AI replies, knowledge bases. They resolve common inquiries without wait time and hand complex cases to humans with context.</p><h3>Documents and administration</h3><p>Data extraction from PDFs, contract generation, summaries and reports. They save hours on routine paperwork.</p><h3>Analytics</h3><p>Data analysis, predictive models, natural-language queries over tables. Useful when you have data but no dedicated analyst on the team.</p><h2>Tool selection criteria</h2><p>Don't choose by popularity alone. Consider: does it support Croatian (or at least good-quality English), is the price appropriate for your volume, does it integrate with your existing systems, and does it keep data in the EU (important for GDPR)? A broader overview of context for Croatian businesses is in our <a href="ai-alati-hrvatska.html">article on the best AI tools for businesses in Croatia</a>.</p><h2>When not to use AI</h2><p>AI is not the answer to everything. Avoid it when: the decision requires human judgment and responsibility (e.g. medical diagnoses, legal advice), data is too sparse or unstable for reliable models, the process is one-off and automation is not worth the investment, or the customer explicitly wants to speak with a person. In such cases AI can prepare materials, but the final decision should remain with humans.</p><h2>Practical approach</h2><p>Before buying tools, define your goal and measurable KPIs. A simple structure for this is provided by our <a href="ai-strategija-mali-biznis.html">AI strategy guide for small business</a> and the automation article. Start with one category – e.g. marketing or support – and expand only when you see results.</p><h2>Frequently asked questions</h2><h3>Which AI tool is best to start with?</h3><p>Depends on priority: for automation – Make or Zapier; for content writing – ChatGPT or Claude; for support – platforms with built-in chatbots (e.g. Intercom, Drift). For the Croatian market it's important to check language support and GDPR compliance.</p><h3>How much do AI tools cost for small business?</h3><p>Many have free tiers or starter plans from €10–50 per month. Cost grows with volume (e.g. number of users, automated tasks). For smaller businesses €50–150 per month for 2–3 tools is often enough.</p><h3>Do I need to hire an expert for implementation?</h3><p>For simple tools (e.g. text generation) usually not. For automations, integrations, and AI agents it's often more cost-effective to bring in a consultant or partner with experience – you save time and reduce setup errors.</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>AI tools for entrepreneurs come in many categories. The key is to choose what fits your goals, test in small steps, and know when AI is not the right choice. MangAi helps businesses in Croatia and the region select and implement tools that deliver real value.</p></div>
