Small businesses in Croatia and the region can also have a clear direction – the approach just needs to be adapted: less documentation, more concrete steps and measurable results. In this article we propose a framework that even a team of a few people can apply.</p><h2>Why small business needs an AI strategy</h2><p>Without some kind of plan you easily fall into the trap of “trying everything” – buying different tools, nobody uses them consistently, and ROI stays unclear. A simple strategy doesn’t have to be a 50-page document; it’s enough to answer a few questions and pick 1–2 priorities.</p><h3>What you want to achieve in the next 6–12 months</h3><p>Examples: reduce time on administrative tasks, improve response to client inquiries, speed up content creation for marketing, or use data better for decision-making. One main goal per quarter is often more realistic than five parallel projects.</p><h2>Three pillars of a practical AI strategy</h2><p>You can boil the strategy down to three questions: where can AI save time or improve quality right away, what tools or partners do we need, and how will we measure success.</p><h3>Pillar 1: Opportunity identification</h3><p>Walk through a typical week of the team – which repetitive tasks take the most time? Email, reports, data entry, answering common inquiries? Those activities are usually the best candidates for the first phase of automation or AI assistance.</p><h3>Pillar 2: Tools and resources</h3><p>You don’t have to build everything yourself. Decide whether you’ll use ready-made SaaS tools, hire a consultant for setup, or combine both. For small business it’s often more cost-effective to start with tools that go live quickly, then add custom solutions later if needed.</p><h3>Pillar 3: Measurement and adjustment</h3><p>Define 2–3 KPIs: e.g. hours saved per week, number of inquiries handled without human intervention, or response quality (survey). Regular short reviews let you adjust the strategy without major reorganization.</p><h2>Common mistakes and how to avoid them</h2><p>Small business often errs in two ways: too big a first step (a project that runs for months) or purely ad-hoc use of tools with no clear goal. Both lead to frustration and loss of confidence in AI. Better to start with one pilot – e.g. automating replies to common inquiries – and only after success expand to other processes.</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>An AI strategy for small business doesn’t have to be complicated. Clear intent, one or two priorities, and simple measurement of results are enough to keep the team aligned and make AI investment deliver visible results. MangAi helps owners and managers in Croatia and the region define such an approach and implement it step by step.</p></div>
