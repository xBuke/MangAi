  "faqs": [
    { "q": "How can you help my business?", "a": "MangAI offers AI automation and solutions for businesses: automation and workflows, personal brand and growth systems, custom applications and micro-SaaS, and consulting and advisory. We work with real estate, beauty, marketing agencies, and service businesses.", "tags": ["help", "services", "business"] },
    { "q": "What AI services do you offer?", "a": "We offer: automation and workflows (CRM, leads, social media, back-office), personal brand and growth systems (AI-assisted content creation, branding), custom applications and micro-SaaS, and consulting and advisory (AI roadmaps, audits, education).", "tags": ["services", "ai", "automation"] },
    { "q": "AI agents or chatbots — what's the difference?", "a": "Both: AI agents and chatbots are part of our solutions. Chatbots answer inquiries and triage; agents can schedule appointments, qualify leads, and work 24/7. The choice depends on your goal — leads, sales, support, or bookings.", "tags": ["agents", "chatbot", "ai"] },
    { "q": "I run an agency — what do I get?", "a": "For marketing agencies we offer AI for faster drafts, campaigns, and content; lead gen and follow-up automation; and custom systems for your clients (chatbots, bookings). White-label solutions for your clients are also possible.", "tags": ["agency", "marketing", "lead"] },
    { "q": "How much does it cost?", "a": "For off-the-shelf tools, a realistic range is around €50–200 per month for a smaller business. Custom solutions have a higher upfront cost (e.g. several thousand euros for setup). Free AI business analysis via the form below.", "tags": ["cost", "price", "budget"] },
    { "q": "What are AI tools?", "a": "AI tools are software applications that use artificial intelligence to perform tasks that would otherwise require human work — e.g. answering inquiries, preparing documents, or sales support. For small businesses in Croatia and the region that means tools that can work in local language and fit limited resources.", "tags": ["ai", "tools"] },
    { "q": "Are AI tools expensive for small businesses?", "a": "Many off-the-shelf tools offer free tiers or packages of a few tens of euros per month. For 2–3 tools in a small firm a realistic range is around €50–200 per month. Cost depends on scope and number of users.", "tags": ["cost", "small business"] },
    { "q": "Do I need a developer for AI automation?", "a": "For simple off-the-shelf tools (e.g. text generation, template chatbots) usually not. For automation and integrations with your systems it's often better to hire a consultant or partner with experience — you save time and reduce setup errors.", "tags": ["developer", "implementation"] },
    { "q": "How long does implementation take?", "a": "It depends on complexity: one clear use case (e.g. answering common inquiries) can be live in a few weeks. Custom solutions or multiple processes take longer — typically from a few weeks to a few months.", "tags": ["implementation", "time"] },
    { "q": "Is AI safe for business data?", "a": "It's important to use tools that keep data in the EU and comply with GDPR. For business and personal data check provider terms and prefer solutions with a clear privacy policy and data processing agreement option.", "tags": ["gdpr", "security"] },
    { "q": "What is AI business automation?", "a": "AI business automation means using software with artificial intelligence to perform repetitive business tasks — from answering inquiries to admin and lead tracking — with less manual work and human control over decisions.", "tags": ["automation", "business"] },
    { "q": "How much does automation cost in Croatia?", "a": "For off-the-shelf tools a realistic range is around €50–200 per month for a smaller business with 1–2 automated processes. Custom solutions have a higher upfront cost (e.g. several thousand euros for setup). Price depends on scope and complexity.", "tags": ["cost", "automation", "croatia"] },
    { "q": "Can AI track meetings and write summaries?", "a": "Yes. A personal AI assistant can track meetings, create summaries, extract action items, and send follow-ups or notes via email or your existing tools.", "tags": ["meetings", "summaries", "ai assistant"] }
